# FounderWell Demo Progress

## Overview
This branch contains work-in-progress for the FounderWell demo implementation, focusing on citation system integration and code quality improvements.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Citation System
- Created citation helper utilities (`lib/citation-helpers.ts`)
- Implemented placeholder citation creation during streaming
- Added citation processing and normalization
- Support for API v2.0 citation format with backward compatibility

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed excessive console.log statements throughout the codebase
- Improved TypeScript typing (removed `any` types where possible)
- Added proper error handling without verbose logging
- Enhanced type safety in portal configuration

### 3. Chat System Enhancements
- Improved streaming response handling in `hooks/use-ask-stream.ts`
- Better clarification loop support
- Progressive citation display during streaming
- Cleaner error handling in chat page

### 4. Portal Configuration
- Enhanced TypeScript types in `lib/portal-config.ts`
- Better type guards for settings normalization
- Improved backward compatibility handling

## Files Modified

### Modified Files:
- `.tool-versions` - Updated Node.js version to 24.4.0
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added portal configuration system documentation
- `app/(default)/chat/page.tsx` - Removed console logs, improved typing
- `app/(default)/og/route.tsx` - Added alt text to image
- `app/actions/ask-stream.ts` - Refactored citation processing, removed logs
- `hooks/use-ask-stream.ts` - Major cleanup, extracted citation helpers
- `lib/portal-config.ts` - Improved TypeScript types and type guards

### New Files:
- `lib/citation-helpers.ts` - Citation processing utilities
- `API_CITATION_SPEC.md` - API citation format specification
- `CODE_REVIEW.md` - Code review notes
- `PRP-clarification-loop.md` - PRP clarification loop documentation

## Technical Notes

### Citation Processing
The citation system now uses dedicated helper functions:
- `processCitations()` - Normalizes citation data from API
- `createPlaceholderCitations()` - Creates temporary citations during streaming

This improves code reusability and makes the streaming logic cleaner.

### Type Safety
Improved type definitions for:
- Settings and PortalSettings interfaces
- Citation types (AskCitation)
- Proper type guards in normalizeSettings()

## Next Steps
- Test citation display in production-like environment
- Monitor streaming performance with real API
- Consider adding citation click tracking
- Add unit tests for citation helpers

## Status
**In Progress** - Main functionality complete, needs production testing
